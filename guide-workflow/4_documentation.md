# Documentation

### Process

We follow a structured approach to managing our documentation to ensure efficiency and accessibility. We keep all our documentation centralized by storing it in the project repository's `reports` or `docs` folder, establishing a single source of truth. To facilitate easy navigation, we organize documents by category, creating subfolders for research, sprint release notes, and other relevant categories. We use consistent naming conventions for our files, making them easily searchable and recognizable. Leveraging the repository's version control system allows us to track changes and updates to our documentation over time.

  

### Sharing

When sharing documents with clients, we export them to PDF format to guarantee they are viewable on any device. While optional tools like ClickUp are available for documentation purposes, we always ensure to sync or reference back to the main repository to maintain clarity.

  

### Diagrams

Whenever possible, we try to create diagrams to visually illustrate aspects of the project, like architecture, data pipelines, agent flows, etc. We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create these.

### Principles

1. **Clarity is Key**: Write in simple language and short sentences to make the documentation easy to understand.
2. **Be Concise**: Include only necessary information to keep the document focused and readable.
3. **Regular Updates**: Update documentation consistently to reflect the latest project status and decisions.
4. **Use Visuals**: Incorporate diagrams, screenshots, and charts to complement text and aid comprehension.
5. **Review and Edit**: Have someone else review your documentation to catch errors and unclear sections.
6. **Template Consistency**: Use templates for common documents like release notes to maintain consistency across projects.
7. **Leverage AI**: Use AI tools to help you write effective and clear documentation faster.

  

### Example Release Notes

Refer to the attached example release notes from our recent sprint. If you work with sprints, this format can effectively communicate progress and outcomes to the team and stakeholders. Adjust the structure to fit your project's needs and development cycles.
