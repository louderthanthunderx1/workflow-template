# System Overview

### Goal

To have a well-defined development workflow that can be repeated for every new project, ensuring efficient operations, easy referencing to old projects, and improving the quality of your work.

  

### Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the system straightforward and easy to navigate and manage.
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize workflows and automate repetitive tasks to increase productivity and reduce manual processing time.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure smooth interoperability across various tools and systems used by data professionals to facilitate collaboration and access from multiple devices and operating systems.
4. **Future-Proofing**: Incorporate flexible architectures and scalable solutions that can adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards to sustain long-term functionality and relevance.
5. **Collaboration**: Foster a collaborative environment where team members can easily share and work on data projects together.
6. **Version Control**: Implement version control mechanisms to track changes and manage different iterations of data assets effectively.
7. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for processes, data sources, and transformations to ensure transparency and reproducibility in data projects.
