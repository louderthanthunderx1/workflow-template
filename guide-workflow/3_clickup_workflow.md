# ClickUp Workflow

I use [ClickUp](https://clickup.pxf.io/c/5109088/1416724/16855) to handle all our development tasks at Datalumina. I suggest you follow my lead because I'll share templates and automations made just for this method. But, if you prefer, you can set up a similar system with popular tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), or [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

### Features

After creating the project, you'll want to fill in the initial features of the project. You can start by listing all the features here that you included in the proposal, which we covered in the `Proposal Formula` in week 4.

  

If you're working with a team, it's important to clearly describe each feature and define a Definition of Done (DoD). Assign tasks to team members and plot dates where possible. Everything that you do here becomes more important as you start to work together with more people. Nonetheless, it's good practice to train yourself to work like this, even if it's just you.

  

### Working on Features

To start working on features, copy the branch name from your Kanban board, check out the new branch, complete the feature, and push all the changes to your branch. Then, create a PR (Pull Request) to your main branch to merge everything. Ensure there are no conflicts and merge the request, completing the feature. Finally, delete both the local and remote branches to clean everything up. Now you can continue with the next feature, following a similar workflow.
